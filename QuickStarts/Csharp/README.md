# C# QuickStart Sample

## Description
This repository contains a very simple C# console application that implements the Microsoft Graph Security API.

### Examples Provided
- GET all alerts
- GET and PATCH one alert
- GET all secure scores
- GET all secure score control profiles
- PATCH one secure score control profile
- GET all TI Indicators
- GET, PATCH, and DELETE one TI indicator
- POST, PATCH, and DELETE multiple TI indicators
- DELETE multiple TI indicators by External IDs
> * PATCH and DELETE bulk TI indicators currently support only `Azure Sentinel` **targetProduct**.
> * **targetProduct** and **expirationDateTime** are required for PATCH one TI indicator and PATCH multiple TI indicators.

## App Registration
To configure the sample, you'll need to register a new application in the Microsoft [Application Registration Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps).
Follow these steps to register a new application:
1. Sign in to the [Application Registration Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) using either your personal or work or school account.

2. Choose **New registration**.

3. Enter an application name, and choose **Register**.

4. Next you'll see the overview page for your app. Copy and save the **Application Id** field. You will need it later to complete the configuration process.

5. Under **Certificates & secrets**, choose **New client secret** and add a quick description. A new secret will be displayed in the **Value** column. Copy this password. You will need it later to complete the configuration process and it will not be shown again.

6. Under **API permissions**, choose **Add a permission > Microsoft Graph**.

1. Under **Application Permissions**, add the permissions/scopes required for the sample. This sample requires **ThreatIndicators.ReadWrite.OwnedBy**, **SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All**.
    >Note: See the [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) for more information about Graph's permission model.

As the final step in configuring the script, modify the AccessToken.cs file.

Update the variables in the file as follows:
```
static readonly string tenantId = "<enter your tenant ID>";
static readonly string appId = "<enter your application/client ID>";
static readonly string appSecret = "<enter your application/client secret>";
```
Once changes are complete, save the file. After you've completed these steps and have received [admin consent](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/python-security-rest-sample#Get-Admin-consent-to-view-Security-data) for your app, you'll be able to run the sample as covered below.

## Notes:
* The "Main" function in the Program.cs class is the entry point for the application.
* Uncomment the code in the function to initialize the classes and call the methods

## Instructions
1) Clone this repository
2) Register an application using the steps above
3) Install necessary dependencies via NuGet
4) Run the application
