# Microsoft Graph Security API Samples

Microsoft Graph Security samples are intended to provide you an example of how various functionalities of entities available in the Microsoft Graph Security namespace could be integrated to enrich your security solutions (applications or services). 

Note: These are samples and are not intended to be directly used in your production environment. Some of these samples are expected to be incomplete and we do encourage the community to contribute to enrich the samples for all.

These samples are available in different programming languages / scripts / formats so as to meet the needs for different developer audiences. Each language sample is hosted in it's own repository, hence depending on where you would like to contribute you can accordingly fork that repository. Details on this is covered in the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Read more about the [various integration options and recognition program for contributions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/Introducing-Microsoft-Graph-Security-API-Recognition-Program-and/ba-p/653102). 

We have samples in the following languages for Microsoft Graph Security API with respective repository locations, links to file issues to track improvements scoped to a repository and respective blogpost and documentation links as applicable.
